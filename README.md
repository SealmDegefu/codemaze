# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

# codemaze

Game text

Your player needs help getting through the maze. Solve the challenges to collect items. Move through the maze using the arrow buttons on your keyboard. Can you help them get to the end?
HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. Web pages use it to know both what words to say, like “Hello there”, but also how it should look. For instance, do you want it to be bigger or smaller or a different color. CSS or Cascading Style Sheets can allow designers to change pages so that many things or pages can be changed at once. This is just the beginning of a computer coding experience. Once you start looking you will see examples everywhere.
Using the basics of HTML and CSS and other coding help your player get through the maze.

Your player needs help getting through the maze. Solve the challenges to collect items. Move through the maze using the arrow buttons on your keyboard. Can you help them get to the end?

Challenge 1
Your player has arrived at the first challenge. There is (an old crow) here. Help us to see the crow.

Choose the line to add the image of the crow:
<img src=”https://ebird.org/species/carcro1” alt =”crow” >

<img src=”https://ebird.org/species/carcro1” alt =”crow” style="width:48px;height:48px;>

Help:
An image tag <img> contains src which tells where to find the image, alt which is a description of the picture, and sometimes has style which might set the size of an item.

Challenge 2
Your player has arrived at the second challenge. It is hard to know what direction to go. Let’s change the color to one that you like.

Choose the line to add a color to the background of the maze:
.challenge-color-1 {
Background-color: yellow;
}
.challenge-color-2 {
Background-color: green;
}
Help:
A CSS tag has a name. Everything that uses that name will be styled in the defined way. Background-color allows for a color to be set for the background.

Challenge 3
Your player has arrived at the third challenge. A Variable is a container for storing data like a number or a name, but it can be anything really. Variables are often names or letters that are assigned.

Choose the line to assign a name and an age to the crow:
var name = “Crow”; var age = 127;
var name = “Snowball”; var age = 12;

Help:
A Variable is declared using different declarations based on the computer language. Some might use num (for number) or int (for integer) for a number. JavaScript which is used for many webpages uses var which is short for variable. You must say it is a variable, then give the name of the variable (technically it can be almost anything, you can call it fuzzWeasel if you want.) Then you have an equal sign and then the data.
